# Motion R-CNN

This repository contains the original
[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)
implementation of
[Motion R-CNN](TODO).
As a baseline, training of
[Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)
on Cityscapes is supported.

## Requirements

- [tensorflow (>= 1.3.0)](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux) with GPU support.
- `pip install opencv-python`

## Acknowledgments
This repository is based on the
[Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).
